class Controller:
    """
    Controller class to facilitate interaction between Model and View

    Takes instructions from Views and runs appropriate Model methods. E.g: If "View Country & Continent" button is
    pressed in Views, it signals the controller with a document_id, which the controller then passes to the Model class
    to perform necessary logic (like filtering data) and displaying the requested information.

    Methods
    -------
    view_country(document_id: str)
        View country and continents of viewers who read the file identified with document_id
